## Three observable trends based on the data

* The vast majority of players are male, representing 84% of the population. However the data suggests that female players have a higher average purchase price, meaning they tend to spend more on each transaction. If the game studio could figure out how to appeal to an audience that included more female players then they could potentially increase the profitability of the in-game purchases.

* The players who are making the most in-game purchases are in either the 16-20 or 21-25 age group. The most profitable players are in the 5-9 age group with an average purchase price of $3.41, but this age group only accounts for 4.1% of total purchases. The data does not show a clear trend in purchase price across age groups, which indicates that it doesn't make sense to change the strategy around targeting different age groups. If we could collect more data points across the range of age groups we might be able to draw a different conclusion.

* Three of the five most popular items were also in the top 5 most profitable items. This makes sense because we would expect the items that players are purchasing the most to also generate the most profit.
